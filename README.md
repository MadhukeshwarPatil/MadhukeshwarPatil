---

## 🔧 How I ship things (my checklist)
1. **Define the measurable goal** (SLO/KPI).  
2. **Prototype small** — prove impact quickly.  
3. **Automate thoroughly** — remove the two-times rule.  
4. **Instrument & measure** — dashboards, alerts, and postmortems.  
5. **Teach & document** — playbooks, onboarding guides, runbooks.

---

## 🎯 Product Transition — Evidence-backed roadmap
- **Short-term (0–6 months):** Lead infra-features as product experiments (developer onboarding, deploy reliability).  
- **Mid-term (6–12 months):** Own small product roadmaps, measure adoption and retention (DX metrics).  
- **Long-term (12–24 months):** Full transition into PM for platform/dev-experience teams.

---

## 🧠 Leadership, Mentorship & Culture
- Led 24×7 L1 support operations; coordinated cross-timezone incident response with SLAs.  
- Mentor for junior engineers: systems-thinking, automated testing, and observability best practices.  
- Advocate for developer empathy — building tools that developers actually use.
